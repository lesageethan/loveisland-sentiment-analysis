# Basic Sentiment Analysis for Love Island Twitter

This program scrapes tweets from twitter, analyses their positivity/negativity, and assigns a score for each love islander according to the number of 'overwhelmingly positive' and 'overwhelmingly negative' tweets containing their name.

## How it Works

The program takes the most recent x number of tweets concerning LI (e.g. 10,000), and filters the results down to only those that are either 'Overwhelmingly Positive' (OP), or 'Overwhelmingly Negative' (ON). From here, it searches for the contestants names in these two categories to get the proportion that their name was mentioned in either of these lights.
